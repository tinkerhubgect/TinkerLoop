## Why Python
	

![python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66952088/155842701-30704efc-2ee0-432f-ab03-898abafb8222.jpg)


## How to setup Python

1. Download the latest version of python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	
2. Follow the installation in instruction as mentioned [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_environment.htm)


## Python Basics (Syllabus)


### Print and Read Input

To print data on console use the commmand

	
```
print("Hello World!");
```

To read data from the user use the command


```
input("Enter something");
```
* Is it possible to store what you have entered ? 
	
### Variable and Data Type

Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values(Numbers, strings etc). This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
```
number1 = 10
str = "Hello"

```

* Can we use every name to variable? No! [Why?](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp)

* Try to read value from user and store in variable and print it

* Read more about data types in python [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)

### If.. Else 

* Is it possible to control the flow of the program? For example you are logging into a system if you have entered correct username and password you should be able to access the account or you must be notified that username or password is wrong. Situation like this we use if... else


Given below is the syntax of if..else in python

```
if expression1:
	statement1
elif expression2:
	statement2
...
...
else:
	statement
```

* Read more about if..else [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/)

* Using [operator](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) in python try to make a program to check whether a number input by user is odd or even?

### Loop

Have you wondered to perform repeated action in program? For example, Spotify play the same song repeatedly

There are two loops in python

* For Loop

``` 
for var in iterable:
    # statements

```

Read more about for loop [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-for-loops/?ref=lbp)
	

* While Loop

```
while expression:
    statement(s)
```

Read more about for loop [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-while-loop/?ref=lbp)

Is Spotify playing same track repeatedely is inifite loop? Is it possible?

Try to print multiplication table using both loops

Can we both loop use in all situation?[here](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-pick-between-a-while-and-for-loop-14ef217c3776?gi=9845f2c9dd0)
